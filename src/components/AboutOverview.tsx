        Studyability Map assists prospective students in finding the ideal
        university and location for their next study destination. The
        visualization will help those who are considering attending a university
        and are in search of their dream institution and place to live.

        There are many considerations for a student to choose their study
        destination. Lee (2014) found that students prefer a comfortable climate
        and value the “reputation of education quality,” which includes how well
        the education is recognized by employers. Doda et al. (2024) pointed out
        that lower living costs and tuition fees can attract students, while
        Eder et al. (2010) observed that language is an important factor, with
        many students leaning towards English-speaking countries.

        Recognizing the difficulty in gathering and comparing information
        through internet searches, Studyability Map streamlines the process,
        making it easier for students to make informed decisions about their
        future. It can also be used by researchers, professors, and admission
        officers to gather and analyze important information about different
        universities.
